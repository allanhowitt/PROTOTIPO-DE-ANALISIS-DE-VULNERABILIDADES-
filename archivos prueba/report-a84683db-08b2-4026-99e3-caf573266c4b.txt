I Summary
=========

This document reports on the results of an automatic security scan.
The report first summarises the results found.
Then, for each host, the report describes every issue found.
Please consider the advice given in each description, in order to rectify
the issue.

All dates are displayed using the timezone "Coordinated Universal Time",
which is abbreviated "UTC".

Vendor security updates are not trusted.

Overrides are off.  Even when a result has an override, this report uses
the actual threat of the result.

Notes are included in the report.Information on overrides is included in the report.

This report might not show details of all issues that were found.
Issues with the threat level "Log" are not shown.
Issues with the threat level "Debug" are not shown.
Issues with the threat level "False Positive" are not shown.
Only results with a minimum QoD of 70 are shown.

This report contains all 2 results selected by the

Note: DCE/RPC or MSRPC services running on this host locally were identified. Re!
porting this list is not enabled by default due to the possible large size of th!
is list. See the script preferences to enable this reporting.

Impact:
An attacker may use this fact to gain more knowledge
  about the remote host.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Filter incoming traffic to this ports.

Issue

NVT:    ICMP Timestamp Reply Information Disclosure
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103190
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.1)
Port:   general/icmp

Summary:
The remote host responded to an ICMP timestamp request.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following response / ICMP packet has been received:
- ICMP Type: 14
- ICMP Code: 0

Impact:
This information could theoretically be used to exploit weak
  time-based random number generators in other services.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Various mitigations are possible:
  - Disable the support for ICMP timestamp on the remote host completely
  - Protect the remote host by a firewall, and block ICMP packets passing throug!
h the firewall in
  either direction (either completely or only for untrusted networks)

Vulnerability Insight:
The Timestamp Reply is an ICMP message which replies to a
  Timestamp message. It consists of the originating timestamp sent by the sender!
 of the Timestamp as
  well as a receive timestamp and a transmit timestamp.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Sends an ICMP Timestamp (Type 13) request and checks if a
  Timestamp Reply (Type 14) is received.
